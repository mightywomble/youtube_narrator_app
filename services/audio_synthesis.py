# Base URL for Gemini API (adjust if needed, but this is standard for gemini-2.0-flash)
# Note: In a Flask backend, you would typically use a library like `google-generativeai`
# or `requests` directly with the correct authentication.
# The `apiKey = ""` pattern is specific to the Canvas frontend environment.
# For Flask, you'd load a Gemini API key from environment variables if you were using Google's generativeai Python client.
# For simplicity, and since a direct Gemini TTS API wasn't explicitly integrated in boilerplate,
# we'll continue with the simulation as before. If you need real Gemini TTS, that's a separate integration.
